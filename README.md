<b>🚗 Automotive Supply Chain Analysis</b>
<br>
Business-Focused Data Analytics Project  
Python | Power BI | SQL-ready

<br><br>

<b>PROJECT OVERVIEW</b>
<br>
This project delivers an end-to-end analysis of an automotive supply chain dataset
with the objective of transforming raw transactional data into decision-ready
business insights.
<br><br>
The analysis focuses on sales performance, logistics efficiency, customer behavior,
and product availability. Python is used for data validation and analysis, while
Power BI is used to build interactive dashboards for business stakeholders.
<br><br>
<b>Core Business Question</b><br>
Which regions, products, shipping modes, and customers are driving revenue, and
where are operational or strategic risks emerging?

<b>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</b>
<br>
Python (Pandas) for data loading, validation, and exploratory analysis  
Jupyter Notebook as the analysis environment  
Power BI for interactive dashboards and business storytelling  
Git and GitHub for version control and portfolio presentation  

<br><br>

<b>DATASET SUMMARY</b>
<br>
Total Records: 1,000 transactions  
Total Columns: 33  
Geography: Multiple U.S. states  
Car Makers: 54  
Car Models: 503  
Total Sales Analyzed: 853 Million USD  
<br><br>

CarMaker, CarModel, State, OrderDate, ShipMode, Sales, Quantity, Discount,  
CustomerName, CustomerFeedback  

<br><br>

<b>ANALYTICAL WORKFLOW</b>
<br>
<b>Data Validation and Exploration</b><br>
The CSV data was loaded using Pandas. Schema, data types, and record counts were
verified. Exploratory analysis was performed to understand sales trends, order
patterns, and customer behavior.
<br><br>
<b>Data Preparation</b><br>
Metrics were aggregated by region, product, shipping mode, and customer to support
dashboard development and stakeholder analysis.
<br><br>
<b>Visualization and Storytelling</b><br>
Three business-focused Power BI dashboards were created to address different
decision-making perspectives.

<br><br>
